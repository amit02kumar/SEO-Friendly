meta tags:-
Meta tags are HTML elements that provide information about a web page's content to search engines and website visitors. They are placed within the head section of a web page's HTML code. While meta tags serve various purposes, they offer several benefits:

(a)- Improved Search Engine Ranking: Meta tags, particularly the meta title and meta description, help search engines understand the content and relevance of a web page. Optimizing these tags with relevant keywords can lead to better search engine rankings and increased organic traffic.

(b)- Enhanced Click-Through Rates (CTR): A well-crafted meta description can attract users to click on your search result by providing a concise and compelling summary of the page's content. This can improve CTR and drive more organic traffic to your site.

(c)- Clear Page Summaries: Meta descriptions provide a concise summary of a web page's content, giving users a clear idea of what to expect when they click on the link. This can help users find the most relevant information quickly.

(d)- Branding and Consistency: Meta tags, especially the meta title, can include your brand name or website's name. This helps with branding and recognition, creating a consistent experience for users across search results.
