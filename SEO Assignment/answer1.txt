SEO:-

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of practices and strategies aimed at improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to attract more organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by ensuring that it appears higher in search engine results for relevant queries.

Importance of SEO:-

(a)- Increased Organic Traffic: SEO helps improve a website's visibility in search engine results, leading to higher organic (non-paid) traffic. This can result in more potential customers and readers visiting your site.

(b)- Credibility and Trust: Websites that appear at the top of search results are often perceived as more credible and trustworthy by users. SEO can help build trust with your audience.

(c)- Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cost-effective way to attract visitors to your site. Once you achieve good rankings, you can maintain traffic without ongoing ad spend.

(d)- Better User Experience: SEO involves optimizing your website for both search engines and users. This results in a better user experience, leading to increased user satisfaction and engagement.
